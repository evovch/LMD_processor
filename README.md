This turned out to be rather a powerful tool to perform analysis of the experimental data gathered using the nXYTER chip via the SysCore readout controller (ROC). It has been developed to analyse the signals from the Hamamatsu H12700 MAPMT for the RICH detector [yet prototype] of the CBM@FAIR experiment and the NeuRad detector [yet prototype] of the EXPERT experiment (SuperFRS@FAIR and FLNR@JINR).
